      <h3>Introduction ≽^- ˕ -^≼</h3>
      <br>

      <p>
        My name is Trish Ann Payumo. I am a computer science student attempting to take on a design perspective
        regarding front-end web development. I may not have exposure to design but I want to learn a lot from this
        experience. (Although I may not have experience in the field of design, the goal is to make the most out of the
        class.)
      </p>

        I am an introvert and a homebody; my hobbies include reading manga/manhwa, listening to music, drawing, enjoying
        scenic views, and playing video games.

        A particular dream or goal I have is to graduate and live a peaceful life. I just want a quiet life where I
        don’t have to worry about a lot of things I currently worry about as a student. I would probably have a couple
        of cats in the future and live my life in a house ( I don’t know if it’s possible in this economy, hopefully I
        do). Also, there’s this quote I live by:
        “Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured. Spend your free time the way you like, not the
        way you think you're supposed to.”
        ― Susan Cain, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking
        Sometimes we do need to appreciate the silence, especially in a world that never stops talking. Tranquility is
        simply an indulgence that some people get to obtain in this lifetime. I do hope to obtain that as well, maybe
        not now, but for the future
