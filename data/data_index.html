        The last 3 games I’ve been playing have been Valorant, Honkai Star Rail, and OW2. I started playing these games
        because my online buddies played it, and I didn’t want to feel left out. However, I am slowly growing into
        liking these games.
        These games are First Person Shooters and I’ve always wanted to get into it. However, it feels kind of
        underwhelming playing by myself, until I found my current online buddies who do play these games with me.

        I upgraded my graphics card from a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 to a GeForce RTX 4070
        recently… I’m really proud of what I upgraded to since I got it on sale for like $600.00 off. I upgraded my rig
        around Black Friday, of 2023 because my older pc couldn’t handle my setup with multiple monitors. I would crash
        or freeze all the time which was a major problem because I’m a CS major.

        I’ve been a Nintendo fan since I was a child. My favorite franchise is Pokemon. I also like ACNH because it was
        a fun single-player game as well. As you can see it's one of my top games. I simply like these chill comfy games
        where I don’t need to compete for something. Also, it portrays a relaxing experience for me, I love the comfy
        and nostalgic vibes.
